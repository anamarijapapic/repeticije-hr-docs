\section*{Summary}
\subsection*{Development of a Web Application for Tutoring}

The aim of this thesis is to develop an intuitive web application that serves
as a platform for connecting students and tutors, with the goal of facilitating
the organization and conduct of tutoring sessions and simplifying the process
of providing and attending lessons, both in-person and online. The application
enables students to easily find and book tutoring sessions, while tutors can
efficiently manage their schedules, offers, and reservations. Participation in
online tutoring sessions is supported through integrated WebRTC peer-to-peer
technology for video calls. The full-stack web application is developed using
the Next.js framework for React, while data storage is handled by a relational
PostgreSQL database through Prisma ORM and managed on the Supabase platform.
This thesis presents the technologies used, the system architecture, business
logic, and the implementation of individual application functionalities.
